# Reshaping data with `gather()` and `spread()`

## Tidy data {.build .smaller}

Hadley Wickham introduced the concept of **tidy data** as a way how data should be organized so it is comfortable to work with ([H. Wickham 2014: Tidy Data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper)). He defined three rules that make a data set tidy:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

</div>

## Why tidy data? {.build}

- a tidy data set allows for easier variable selection, grouping, summarization and visualization
- tools and packages in the *tidyverse* like *dplyr* or *ggplot2* require data to be organized in that way

- the problem: most data you'll get won't be "tidy" from the beginning on &rarr; you'll need to reshape it


## Reshaping untidy data {.build .smaller}

**`OBrienKaiser` from package *carData***

- data from imaginary study
- three treatments: A, B, control
- three measurement types: pretest, posttest, follow-up session
- each measured at five occasions (suffixes `.1` to `.5`)

```
 treatment gender pre.1 pre.2 pre.3 pre.4 pre.5 post.1 post.2 post.3 post.4 post.5 fup.1 ...
         A      M     7     8     7     9     9      9      9     10      8      9     9 ...
         B      F     4     5     7     5     4      7      7      8      6      7     7 ...
   control      M     1     2     4     2     1      3      2      5      3      2     2 ...
       ...
```

Is this data *tidy*?

**No!** You have **several measurements (observations) per row**. This is also called a *wide table format*.

&rarr; hard to work with (e.g. compute mean of all three measurement types separately)

## Reshaping untidy data {.build .smaller}

We can use `gather()` from package *tidyr* to put the measurements in separate rows.

<div class="fullfig">
  <img src="07plotting-figure/tidy-9.png" alt="gathering schema" style="max-height:33%"><br>
  <small>source: [Grolemund, Wickham 2017: R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#gathering)</small>
</div>

## Reshaping untidy data {.smaller .build}

`gather()` takes the following arguments (among others):

1. The data to work with (omit this if you use the pipe operator `%>%`).
2. The "untidy" columns to gather.
3. `key`: The name of the new column containing the measurement types.
4. `value`: The name of the new column containing the measurement values.

```{r}
(tidy_obk <- gather(OBrienKaiser, pre.1:fup.5,
                    key = 'meas_type_occasion', value = 'value'))
```


## Reshaping untidy data {.build .smaller}

Our data is already better to work with, but `meas_type_occasion` still contains two values like "pre.1" (pretest 1) or "fup.4" (follow-up test 4). This violates rule #3: *"Each value must have its own cell."*).

We can use `separate()` (package *tidyr*) to split columns that contain several values. It takes the following arguments  (among others):

1. The data to work with (omit this if you use the pipe operator `%>%`).
2. The column to split.
3. `into`: The names of the new columns.
4. `sep`: A rule for how to split the values. The default is to split on anything that is not a number or character (e.g. slash, period, hyphen, ...).


```{r}
tidy_obk <- separate(tidy_obk, meas_type_occasion,
                      into = c('meas_type', 'meas_occasion'))
```


## Reshaping untidy data {.build .smaller}

Some additional variable conversion and we're done:

```{r}
tidy_obk <- mutate(tidy_obk,
                   meas_type = factor(meas_type, levels = c('pre', 'post', 'fup')),
                   meas_occasion = as.integer(meas_occasion))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tidy_obk
```

&rarr; This is tidy data. It's also called the *long table format*.

## Reshaping untidy data {.build .smaller}

With *this* data we can actually work!

```{r}
tidy_obk %>%
  group_by(treatment, meas_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_measurement = mean(value))
```

**It's better spending some time on data cleanup than struggling with messy data sets!**

## Combining rows {.build .smaller}

`spread()` is the opposite of `gather()`: It combines observations from multiple rows into a single row with more columns. Hence it converts data from the long table format to the wide table format.

<div class="fullfig">
  <img src="07plotting-figure/tidy-8.png" alt="gathering schema" style="max-height:50%"><br>
  <small>source: [Grolemund, Wickham 2017: R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading)</small>
</div>

## Combining rows {.build .smaller}

`economics_long` from package *ggplot2* contains data in long table format:

```
   date       variable    value
   1967-07-01 pce         507. 
   1967-08-01 pce         510. 
   1967-09-01 pce         516. 
   ...
   1967-07-01 pop      198712  
   1967-08-01 pop      198911  
   1967-09-01 pop      199113  
   ...
   1967-07-01 psavert      12.5
   1967-08-01 psavert      12.5
   1967-09-01 psavert      11.7
   ...  
```

For each date, there are five variable types (pce, pop, psavert, unemploy, uempmed) and their respective values.

## Combining rows {.build .smaller}

`spread()` takes the following arguments:

1. The data to work with (omit this if you use the pipe operator `%>%`).
2. `key`: The column containing the variable names.
2. `value`: The column containing the respective variable values.

```{r, include=FALSE}
economics_long <- economics_long %>% select(-value01) %>% ungroup()  # clean up
```

```{r}
spread(economics_long, variable, value)
```


# Plotting with ggplot2

## Data visualization

Grouping, aggregating and summarizing results are important for data analysis. They let you reduce complex data sets to simpler summarizations, compare groups and help to see patterns in your data.

Visualization of your data can have the same benefits and has the power to communicate a message much faster than a table of numbers. However, it requires a **sense for which type of graph or visual representation is appropriate for your data**.

A useful website for inspiration, code examples and caveats is https://www.data-to-viz.com.

## What is *ggplot2*?

<div class="floatright" style="width:20%">
  <img src="07plotting-figure/hex-ggplot2.png" alt="ggplot2 logo" height="180px">
  <small>source: [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)</small>
</div>

- R offers several plotting systems (e.g. base R, *lattice* or *ggplot2*)
- we'll use *ggplot2* because:
    - it's versatile and elegant
    - it employs a well founded theory for declaratively creating graphics called *"Grammar of Graphics"* (Wilkinson 2005)
    - it's part of the *tidyverse* &rarr; plays together well with the tools we already learned

## General concepts behind *ggplot2* {.build .smaller}

There are three basic steps for constructing plots with *ggplot2*:

1. Supply a data set you want to plot to `ggplot()`.
2. Define an **aesthetic mapping** with `aes()`.<br>
    This describes how variables of your data are mapped to visual properties, e.g. variable "age" is plotted on the x-axis and "income" on the y-axis.
3. Add layers of **geoms** (geometrical objects) that describe which graphical primitives to use (e.g. points in a scatter plot or bars in a bar plot).

Additionally, you can further change the appearance of your plot by: 

- altering the **scales** (e.g. use a logarithmic scale, modify display of factors, etc.)
- defining **facets** &rarr; create *small multiples*, each showing a different subset of the data
- changing the **coordinate system** (e.g. to display maps or radial plots)
- changing the overall appearance of the plot by adjusting its **theme** (e.g. change background color, rotate axis labels, etc.)

You combine all these steps with a `+`.

## General concepts behind *ggplot2*

We'll make a plot for historical election results from four states (data set `presidentialElections` from package *pscl*):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sampled_states <- presidentialElections %>%
  distinct(state, south) %>%
  group_by(south) %>%    # group by south / not south
  sample_n(2) %>%        # take 2 from each group
  ungroup() %>%
  select(state) %>%
  unlist(use.names = FALSE)  # convert to simple vector
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sampled_pres <- filter(presidentialElections, state %in% sampled_states)
sampled_pres
```

## Example data {.smaller .build}

Example data: `politicalInformation` from *pscl* package

> Interviewers administering the 2000 American National Election Studies assigned an ordinal rating to each respondent's "general level of information" about politics and public affairs.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
politicalInformation
```

## Distribution of a single variable {.smaller .build}

At first, you should make sure that you either loaded the *tidyverse* package or *ggplot2* package. We define:

1. The data set `politicalInformation`.
2. The aeshetic mapping for a single variable `age`.
3. The graphical representation as histogram with `geom_histogram()`.

```{r, fig.height=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(age)) + geom_histogram()
```

## Distribution of a single variable {.smaller .build}

I hid two messsages produced by ggplot:

```
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
Removed 9 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

- the first tells us that a default value for the number of bins was used &rarr; we set `binwidth = 5` below to make a histogram of age with five-year steps
- the second complains about 9 NA values in the `age` variable &rarr; we can ignore this

```{r, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```


## Distribution of a single variable {.smaller .build}

What if we wanted to know if the distribution of `age` in our sample is different for men and women?

We can produce *boxplots* for both subsets, putting `female` on the x-axis (see how the aesthetics mapping was changed!):

```{r, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(x = female, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Distribution of a single variable {.smaller .build}

A *violin plot* offers better insight about the actual shape of the distribution:

```{r, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(x = female, y = age)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))  # horizontal lines for quartiles
```

## Distribution of a single variable {.smaller .build}

A *density plot* also reveals that there are more younger men in the sample:

```{r, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(age, color = female)) + geom_density()
```

## Counts of a single categorical variable {.smaller .build}

Histograms can be used to bin continuous variables. To show the distribution of a categorical variable we can use a simple *bar chart*:

```{r}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(y)) + geom_bar()
```

## Counts of a single categorical variable {.smaller .build}

A *stacked* and *grouped* bar charts allows to compare groups. Here, we compare groups based on the `collegeDegree` variable by mapping the "fill (color)" aesthetic to it.

By default, the bars get stacked:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(y, fill = collegeDegree)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Counts of a single categorical variable {.smaller}

A *stacked* and *grouped* bar charts allows to compare groups. Here, we compare groups based on the `collegeDegree` variable by mapping the "fill (color)" aesthetic to it.

Setting the bars' `position` to `position_dodge()` creates a grouped bar chart:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(politicalInformation, aes(y, fill = collegeDegree)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
```

## Scatterplots {.smaller .build}

A *scatterplot* displays the relationship between two numeric variables. We'll use the `airquality` and have a look at the relationship between ozone and temperature.

```{r}
head(airquality)
```

## Scatterplots {.smaller}

A *scatterplot* displays the relationship between **two numeric variables**. We'll use the `airquality` and have a look at the relationship between ozone and temperature.

We map `Ozone` to the y-axis and `Temp` to the x-axis and use `geom_point()`:

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + geom_point()
```

## Scatterplots {.smaller .build}

*Overplotting* can easily occur, especially with large data sets.

- happens when multiple data points are drawn on the same spot
- fix it with setting a semi-transparent fill color or apply *jittering*

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.33)  # alpha of 0 is invisible, 1 is opaque
```

## Scatterplots {.smaller}

*Overplotting* can easily occur, especially with large data sets.

- happens when multiple data points are drawn on the same spot
- fix it with setting a semi-transparent fill color or apply *jittering*

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter())
```

## Scatterplots {.smaller .build}

`geom_smooth()` aids the eye in seeing patterns by adding a (local polynomial) regression line and its confidence interval:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.33) +
  geom_smooth()
```

## Line graphs {.smaller .build}

A *line graph* can be used whenever you have an **ordered numeric variable on the x-axis**, such as years.

We'll use a subset of the `presidentialElections` data set from the package *pscl*:

```{r}
(cal_pres <- presidentialElections %>% filter(state == 'California'))
```

## Line graphs {.smaller .build}

We map `year` on the x-axis, the vote share for Democrats `demVote` on the y-axis and add a `geom_line()` layer:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(cal_pres, aes(x = year, y = demVote)) + geom_line()
```

## Line graphs {.smaller}

We can additionally add points like in a scatterplot:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(cal_pres, aes(x = year, y = demVote)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## Line graphs {.smaller .build}

Again, we'll plot the historical election results from four states (data set `presidentialElections` from package *pscl*) stored in an object `sampled_pres`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sampled_pres
```

## Line graphs {.smaller .build}

If we simply use the same command as before, we produce some interesting chaos:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(sampled_pres, aes(x = year, y = demVote)) + geom_line()
```

## Line graphs {.smaller .build}

We have to add another aesthetic mapping (`color = state`) in order to tell apart the states' lines:

```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(sampled_pres, aes(x = year, y = demVote, color = state)) + geom_line()
```


## Saving plots {.build}

A ggplot object can be assigned a name just as any other object in R:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
myplot <- ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
myplot   # shows an "empty" plot
```


## Saving plots {.smaller}

You can re-use the ggplot object and try out different layers:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
myplot + geom_point()
```

## Saving plots {.smaller}

You can re-use the ggplot object and try out different layers or themes:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
myplot + geom_point(position = position_jitter()) + theme_minimal()
```

## Saving plots {.smaller .build}

You can eventually save the plot to disk with `ggsave()`:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
final_plot <- myplot + geom_point(position = position_jitter())
ggsave('07plotting-resources/example_saved_figure.png',
       plot = final_plot,
       width = 4,
       height = 3)
```

<br>

There are several options to configure the output file (see `?ggsave`):

- plot dimensions (by default in inch)
- plot resolution
- format (PNG, PDF, etc.) -- determined by file extension


## Common mistakes {.smaller .build}

A very common mistake is to accidentally put `+` on a new line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
  + geom_point()
```

`Error: Cannot use "+.gg()" with a single argument. Did you accidentally put + on a new line?`

The `+` operator must appear before the line break (the same is true for other operators like `%>%` used in *dplyr*):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Common mistakes {.smaller .build}

The type of your variables determines its scale for plotting. E.g. here you might want to use a discrete scale:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = Month)) +
  geom_point()
```


## Common mistakes {.smaller}

Converting the numerical to a factor tells ggplot that a discrete scale is appropriate:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = as.factor(Month))) +
  geom_point()
```


## What we didn't cover {.build}

This was only a short intro about *a few* types of plots that can be made with ggplot2. For more advanced plots you should learn about:

- other **geoms** that allow to create other types of plots
- **facets** to create "small multiples"
- **scales** to adjust colors, legends, scale intervals, etc.
- **themes** to adjust the overall appearance of a plot

## ggplot extensions {.build}

There are several packages that extend ggplot's capabilities:

- [ggmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html): Spatial visualization (plot geographic data on maps)
- [ggraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/index.html): Graphs and networks
- [ggdag](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/index.html): Analyze and create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- [ggmosaic](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmosaic/index.html): Mosaic plots
- [ggwordcloud](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggwordcloud/index.html): Word clouds
- [gghighlight](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gghighlight/index.html): Highlight lines and points
- [cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html): Combine multiple labelled plots
- [plotly](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html): Create interactive web graphics


## Documentation and other resources {.smaller .build}

The documentation is excellent. If you don't know how a "geom" can be controlled, have a look at it's documentation, e.g.

```
[...]
Aesthetics:
     ‘geom_point’ understands the following aesthetics (required
     aesthetics are in bold):
        • *‘x’*
        • *‘y’*
        • ‘alpha’
        • ‘colour’
        • ‘fill’
        • ‘group’
        • ‘shape’
        • ‘size’
        • ‘stroke’
[...]
```

&rarr; you *must* specify the aesthetics `x` and `y`<br>
&rarr; you *can* make several other properties (e.g. transparency or fill color) dependent on some variable
