- *Matloff 2017: Statistical Regression and Classification*
- *Kuhn & Johnson 2013: Applied Predictive Modeling*

## What *not* to expect

**This is not an in-depth programming course.**

&rarr; we'll write short scripts and learn some fundamental concepts of programming

For programming with R see:

- *Wickham 2014: Advanced R*
- *Grolemund 2014: Hands-On Programming with R: Write Your Own Functions and Simulations*
- *Matloff 2011: The Art of R Programming*

## What is R?

<div class="halffig" style="width:20%">
  <img src="01intro-figure/Rlogo.png">
</div>

- a **free**, **open-source** **statistical programming language** and **computing environment**
- based on *S* language developed at Bell Labs
- initially developed in 1993 by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at University of Auckland, New Zealand
- currently 25th anniversary!

## Why R? {.build}

- free and open-source
- runs on all major Operating Systems
- well tested and trusted software base
- combines flexible programming model with wide range of statistical methods
- active development and broad community
- easily extensible through *R packages*

## Why R?

increasingly popular, esp. in the science community

</div>


## "Base R" and the "tidyverse" {.build}

**"Base R" or "R Core": Core functions of the R language without additional packages**

- syntax of R "historically grown" since 25 years &rarr; many ambiguities, differing concepts
- can be awkward and confusing for beginners

```{r,eval=FALSE}
with(airquality, sapply(split(Ozone, Month), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## "Base R" and the "tidyverse" {.build}

<div class="floatright" style="width:20%">
  <img src="01intro-figure/tidyverse.png" alt="tidyverse logo" height="180px">
  <small>source: [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)</small>
</div>

**tidyverse: set of packages that share the same "design philosophy, grammar, and data structures"**

- https://www.tidyverse.org/
- tries to modernize R language; fosters better readable code

```{r,eval=FALSE}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarize(m_oz = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))
```


<div class="clearfloat"></div>

## "Base R" and the "tidyverse"

Base R:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
with(airquality, sapply(split(Ozone, Month), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

tidyverse:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarize(m_oz = mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## R packages and CRAN

R's functionality can be extended by *packages* which are available in the *Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)*.

Popular packages include:

- *ggplot2* (data visualization)
- *dplyr* and *tidyr* (data manipulation)
- *foreign* (read/write data from Stata, SPSS, SAS, etc.)
- *RColorBrewer* (popular color schemes from [colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org))
- *caret* and *Keras* (advanced regression and machine learning models)


# Let's get started


## RStudio

- *RStudio* is an **Integrated development environment (IDE)** for R
- it's a comfortable **interface** to R
- analogy: if R is the engine, then RStudio is the car around it
- offers:
    - interactive console
    - script editor with error checking
    - package manager
    - data, plot and file viewers
    - ...

## RStudio Server

**Only for WZB staff:**

For those who can't / don't want to install RStudio on their computer there's an option to use RStudio via the browser:

https://rstudio.wzb.eu

Use your WZB login there.

## Working interactively: Using the Console

<div class="fullfig">
  <img src="01intro-figure/rstudio-screenshot-console.png" alt="RStudio console">
</div>

## Working interactively: Console tips & tricks

- usually on the (lower) left
- startup message showing R version and license information
- input **prompt** "> ..." waiting for your commands <small>(commands are issued using ENTER)</small>
- output: depends on data type
- **general hint: all commands are case sensitive**
- recommendation: set to English language ([depends on OS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575180/how-to-change-language-settings-in-r#13575413))

<div class="notes">
- "hello world"
- 'hello world'
- produce errors:
  hello world
  hello
- short calculator usage
- keys:
    - multi-line statements
    - copy+paste
    (- up/down)
    (- tab completion)
    - Ctrl+L
</div>

## Some general R syntax rules {.smaller .build}

- a *syntax* describes the rules of a programming language
- a programming language is **very** strict about the grammar 

Some general rules:

**1. Each line is a statement ("command"), several statements are evaluated from top to bottom.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c <- a + b
d <- sqrt(c)
```

<br>

**Exception:** If an expression is not closed (see paranthesis rule below), it can span several lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a * (b
+ c
+ d)
```

<br>

This is the same as `a * (b + c + d)`.

## Some general R syntax rules {.smaller .build}

**2. Spaces are generally ignored.**

These are all equivalent:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a+b
a + b
a    +  b
```

<br>

Use spaces and indents to make your code more readable.

## Some general R syntax rules {.smaller .build}

**3. Expressions must be closed.**

There are different special characters, that mark the beginning and end of something, e.g. the beginning and end of a character string or an  expression:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
"hello world"
a * (b + c)
x[1]
```

<br>
More complex statements contain nested expressions. Nested expressions are evaluated from inner to outer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[c(1, 3)]
```

<br>
**For each opened paranthesis, quotation mark, etc. there must be a closing counterpart in the correct order.** This would be wrong:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y[c(1, 3])
## Error: unexpected ']'
```

## Some general R syntax rules {.smaller .build}

**4. Comma and dots**

Commas split things: Mainly *arguments (parameters)* of *functions*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
log(x, 5)
```

&rarr; passes the parameters `x` and `5` to compute the base 5 logarithm of `x`.

Comma **cannot** be used to group digits in large numbers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
population <- 3,350,000
## Error: unexpected ',' in "population <- 3,"
```

<br>
A dot is used as decimal point:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
3.1415
```

## Pimp my R: Installing and using a package

<div class="fullfig">
  <img src="01intro-figure/rstudio-screenshot-packages.png" alt="RStudio package manager">
</div>


## Pimp my R: Package manager in RStudio

- packages (aka "libraries") extend R's functionality
- on the right, "Packages" tab
- allows to view, install and update R packages from CRAN
- **first task for you:** install the following packages
    - *tidyverse* (this is a *meta-package* containing lots of other packages â€“ it will take a while)
    - *swirl* (this is package for interactive exercises that we'll use later)


## Pimp my R: Package manager tips & tricks

- alternative: use command on Console:

    `install.packages("<PACKAGE_NAME>")`
- then, to load a package:

    `library(<PACKAGE_NAME>)` (without quotation marks!)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


## Pimp my R: Package manager tips & tricks

If you forget to load a package, you will be confronted with errors like these:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qplot()
## Error in qplot() : could not find function "qplot"
diamonds
## Error: object 'diamonds' not found
```


## Knowing where you R: The working directory concept

- the *working directory* or *path* is the location on your computer's drive, at which your current R session is working
- reading files, writing files, etc. is **relative to this path**
- finding out the current working path: `getwd()`
- setting the working path: `setwd("<PATH>")`

- **absolute path:** path starts with `/` (MacOS / Unix) or `C:\`
    - depends on your *personal* folder structure
- **relative path:** path starts directly with a file or folder name
    - relative from some other path, e.g. the current working path

## Knowing where you R: An example

- `getwd()` returns `"/Users/NoName/Documents"`
- the file you want to load is at `/Users/NoName/Documents/MyProject/data.csv`
- you can load the file with: `read.csv("MyProject/data.csv")`
- what if the working path were at...
    - `/Users/NoName/Documents/MyProject`?
    - `/Users/NoName/Research`?

## Tips for file and folder names

- do not use spaces (use `_` instead)
    - "funny&nbsp;&nbsp;file&nbsp;name&nbsp;.xlsx" â€“ how many spaces do you count?
- try to stick to the English alphabet, avoid special characters
- keep it short
- can be case sensitive
- for a single project, use the same root directory for scripts and data
- do not use absolute paths in your code &rarr; it will only run on your computer!

## RStudio file manager {.smaller}

<div class="halffig" style="max-width:70%">
  <img src="01intro-figure/rstudio-screenshot-files.png" alt="RStudio file manager">
</div>

- on the right, "Files" tab
- "More" button allows to "Set as Working Directory" and "Go to Working Directory"


## Calling the Rescue team: Getting help

Using R's internal help system:

- `help(<SYMBOL>)` / shortcut: `?<SYMBOL>`
- `<SYMBOL>` can be anything: a function, a package, a data set
- shown on the lower right side in the "Help" tab in RStudio
- example: `?getwd` or `?mean`

## Calling the Rescue team: Getting help

<div class="fullfig">
  <img src="01intro-figure/rstudio-screenshot-help.png" alt="RStudio help view">
</div>


## Other useful help functions {.build}

- show example usages: `example(<SYMBOL>)`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
example(mean)
## mean> x <- c(0:10, 50)
## mean> xm <- mean(x)
## mean> c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10))
## [1] 8.75 5.50
```

<br>
- list all available functions containing a keyword: `apropos("<SEARCH>")`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
apropos('matrix')
## [1] "anyDuplicated.matrix"       "as.data.frame.matrix" ...
## [4] "as.matrix"                  "as.matrix.data.frame" ...
```

## Other useful help functions: Vignettes and online help

*Vignettes* provide a short introduction to a specific package, function or topic. Not all packages offer a vignette.

- `vignette()` shows all available vignettes
- `vignette('<TOPIC>')` openes a vignette for a specific topic (e.g. `vignette('dplyr')` &rarr; introduction to the *dplyr* package in the help viewer)

- packages have info page on CRAN (search online for `"cran <PACKAGE>"`)
    - example: [ggplot2 CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
- many packages have own websites / online documentation, especially the tidyverse packages ([tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/))


## Handling problems and frustration {.build}

- R has a steep learning curve
- but it's worth the effort!

- programming languages are not *fault tolerant*, they're relentless in case of typos, syntax errors, etc.
- you need to be exact

- if you know R, you can learn other programming languages easier
- BUT: better don't try to learn more than one programming language at once


## In case of fire, do not run {.build}

If you encounter an error:

- look closely and/or let someone else look closely
- break into smaller pieces and repeat
- use minimal data to reproduce error
- have a look at examples that use similar functions or make similar calculations
- learn to use a *debugger*
- search for help online (see tips on next slide)
    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - [R-help mailinglist](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html)


## Getting help online

Web search query patterns:

- `"r <PACKAGE> <PROBLEM>"`
- `"r <PROBLEM>"`

Reduce error messages to the general problem:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summarize(airquality, m_oz = mean(SolarR))
## Error in summarise_impl(.data, dots): Evaluation error:
## object 'SolarR' not found.
```

<br>&rarr; possible search query: `"r dplyr summarize object not found"`


## Getting help online

Example 2:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean(airquality$Ozone)
## [1] NA
```

&rarr; possible search query: `"r mean always returns NA"`

Example 3:

Sometimes, error messages provide hints:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(airquality, Month = 7)
## Error: `Month` (`Month = 7`) must not be named, do you need `==`?
```

# Tasks

## Tasks {.even-smaller}

<div class="floatright" style="width:20%">
  <img src="01intro-figure/cats.jpg" alt="cute cats" height="180px">
  <small>source: [attackofthecute.com](http://attackofthecute.com/)</small>
</div>

1. If not done already, install the packages, *tidyverse*, *swirl* and *MASS*
2. Load the packages *MASS* and *tidyverse*. Loading these packages will produce some messages on the console. What do you think do they mean? (If you don't know, just make a wild guess!)
3. Load the builtin dataset "cats" provided by the package MASS (Hint: Run `data(cats)` to load the data)
4. Inform yourself about the data using R's help system â€“ What are the variables in the dataset?
5. View the data using 4 different perspectives:
    - Issue simply the command `cats` at the console â€“ What generally happens when you simply use an object's name as command?
    - Using the functions `head` and `tail`.
    - Using RStudios `View` function (use the function from the console and also check out the small table icon in the "Environment" tab in the top right pane)
6. Construct a *scatter plot* of the data using `qplot` from the *ggplot2* package (incl. in *tidyverse*)
    - inform yourself on the web, about what a scatter plot is
    - see the documentation for `qplot` in R's help system
    - plot `Bwt` (body weight) on the x-axis and `Hwt` (heart weight) on the y-axis
    - Hint: a scatterplot can be generated with a command like this:
    - `qplot(<VARIABLE ON X>, <VARIABLE ON Y>, data = <DATASET>)`
